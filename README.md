# nvim-lua-plugin-template

This repository is a template for Neovim plugins written in Lua.

The intention is that you use this template to create a new repository where you then adapt this readme and add your plugin code.
The template includes the following:

- Github workflows to run linters and tests
- Minimal test setup
- editorconfig
- A .luacheckrc


To get started writing a Lua plugin, I recommend reading the [nvim-lua-guide][nvim-lua-guide].


Things you should avoid:

- Automatically setting up global mappings. Instead prefer a `.setup {}` function where users can opt-in to default mappings, or let them configure the mappings on their own.
- To be extended ...


The remainder of the README is text that can be preserved in your plugin:

## Development

### Run tests


Running tests requires [plenary.nvim][plenary] to be checked out in the parent directory of *this* repository.
You can then run:

```bash
nvim --headless --noplugin -u tests/minimal.vim -c "PlenaryBustedDirectory tests/ {minimal_init = 'tests/minimal.vim'}"
```

Or if you want to run a single test file:

```bash
nvim --headless --noplugin -u tests/minimal.vim -c "PlenaryBustedDirectory tests/path_to_file.lua {minimal_init = 'tests/minimal.vim'}"
```
